# FootballHub

**FootballHub** is a web application that provides live and upcoming football match information using the Football API. Matches are cached in Redis to reduce API requests and improve performance. The application supports team search, live match tracking, and progressive features that will be added over time.

üóÑ Caching & API Quota Management

Live matches and team fixtures are cached in Redis to reduce API requests.

TTL (time-to-live) for cached data: 24 hours.

Redis ensures data persists even if the server is restarted.

Cache is automatically used if available, reducing the need for repeated API calls.
